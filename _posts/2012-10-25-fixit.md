This application allows users to report broken streetlights, potholes, graffiti, and other public property issues that require city attention. Once  The issues are reported, Fixit! asks other users in the area to confirm or refute the request, the results are collected, and then dispatched to the appropriate  personnel who then have a sense of which issues are most affecting the citizens.
