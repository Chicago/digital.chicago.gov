Beginning June 11, 2012 in targeted areas of the city, the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation will begin to implement grid-based garbage collection services. We encourage you to share this information with your neighbors and appreciate your cooperation and flexibility during this transition as we work to make our services as efficient as possible for our residents.
