In the race to innovate the City’s technology capacities, Mayor Emanuel went for the Gold…stein. In October, the future of the Department of Innovation and Technology was put squarely into the hands of Brett Goldstein. Brett was named Chief Data Officer when the Mayor took office in 2011 and led the City’s efforts to lead on open data, promote government transparency and bring data-driven decision making to City Hall.

Mayor Emanuel and Commissioner Goldstein solidified our commitment to open, accessible public data by issuing an executive order to ensure that more department and agencies committee to publishing even more data to the portal. Beginning next year, the Chief Data Officer will publish an annual report on Chicago’s open data. The report will summarize the extent Chicago’s government data is viewable to the public with a mission to expand the amount of data offered to the public. Also, departments are now responsible to identify an open data coordinator to champion open data in their agencies.

As a result, Chicago will release more data to empower residents and work to fuel an economy around online and smartphone apps. Read [more](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2012/december_2012/mayor_emanuel_expandsopendataoncityportalwithexecutiveorder.html).
