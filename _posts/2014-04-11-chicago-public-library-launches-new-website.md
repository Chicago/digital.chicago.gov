Introducing Chicago Public Library’s [new and improved website](http://chipublib.org), accessible on your phone or tablet so you can take the library with you on the go! The website features an improved library catalog and search features and greater accessibility so that library resources are always right at your fingertips.

CPL has partnered with software company [BiblioCommon](http://www.bibliocommons.com/)[s](http://www.bibliocommons.com/) to re-envision the library’s online experience which included the site’s development, research, design, and ongoing enhancements that will be rolled out over the next three years. The new online experience integrates with the library&#8217;s catalog, showcasing the Library&#8217;s diverse range of collections, events, and services. CPL is the first library system to date to launch this innovative online platform. The new website, catalog, and mobile apps are all “software as a service” providing the foundation for continuous innovation while reducing the need for costly in-house infrastructure and staff technical expertise.

You&#8217;ll immediately notice the more customer-friendly features, including the ability to create a unique user name and PIN, keep a history of what you have checked out and a wish list of what you want to borrow in the future. You can also rate titles, as well as write and read reviews of books, movies and music &#8211; visible not only to other CPL patrons, but also to the community of the 200 libraries around the world currently using BiblioCommons’ catalog platform.

And of course, the new website also adapts to any screen size, like smart phones and tablets; the responsive design ensures users have the same experience&#8211;no matter the mobile device. Free apps will also be available for iPhone/iPod Touch and Android.
