  &#8220;More than two million Blackhawks fans showed their passion and enthusiasm today as the Blackhawks paraded the Stanley Cup from the United Center through the Loop to Grant Park. As many of the Blackhawks noted from the stage, Chicago has the best fans in the world. We saw that yet again as our city came together for a celebration that every member of our community could take pride in and enjoy.&#8221; &#8211; MRE
