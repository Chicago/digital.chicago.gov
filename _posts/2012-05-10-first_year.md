Nearly one year ago, Mayor Emanuel took office with a promise to make government more open, transparent and accountable to you, the tax payers. Our first year together in office has proven that while Chicago&#8217;s challenges are great, the power of this City to come together, challenge the status quo and make real change is unparalleled. We look forward once again hearing from you as we continue to chart our path forward together.
