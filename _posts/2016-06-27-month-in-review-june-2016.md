This past June was a busy month for tech initiatives that focused on increasing collaboration with communities, civic technologists, and developers:

  * The [Array of Things](http://arrayofthings.github.io/) project is headed to launch the initial sensors The [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/smart-chicagos-array-of-things-civic-engagement-goals-model/), University of Chicago, Argonne National Labs, and City of Chicago teamed-up to [release a draft privacy policy](http://arrayofthings.github.io/privacypolicy.html) for public feedback. Additionally, Smart Chicago led 2 public forums to get feedback , concerns, and suggestions. This process is used to help ensure Array of Things is useful for communities and [addresses any concerns from the public.](http://www.govtech.com/data/Chicago-CIO-Addresses-IoT-Privacy-Concerns-Citizen-Engagement.html?utm_content=bufferf3f82&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
  * Chicago&#8217;s OpenGrid project turned six-months old. And the real-time, open-source situational awareness platform had it&#8217;s first major release since the launch. Likewise, beginning in July, other developers from around the world will be able to collaborate with the City of Chicago to build a better platform. Chicago will be [opening a weekly phone call with anyone wishing to contribute to the project](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/calling-developers-help-us-build-opengrid/), which will improve collaboration on the project to deliver better features. Email <developers@cityofchicago.org> if you would like to stay informed when the calls are open.
  * Chicago Park District, City of Chicago, and a group of volunteer data scientists [teamed-up to develop a new statistical model to predict _E. Coli_ levels at Chicago&#8217;s beaches](http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/taking-predictive-analytics-to-the-beach-855) on Lake Michigan. The model is being piloted this summer, which will bring greater accuracy to help officials determine when bacteria levels in Chicago&#8217;s beaches may be too high. The project was an unprecedented partnership between city officials and talented researchers to use data to improve the quality of life for Chicagoans. Other data scientists, researchers, and scientists can [view the entire code online on the city&#8217;s GitHub website](https://github.com/Chicago/e-coli-beach-predictions).

Chicago&#8217;s open data portal grew substantially this week after launching [a pair of new data sets](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/an-open-data-gift-for-chicago-bike-week/), including the largest data set to date, on the open data portal during Bike Week about the city&#8217;s DIVVY bike share program. Users can now see the [history of DIVVY bike availability](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Bicycle-Stations-Historical/eq45-8inv) since 2013. Likewise, [details of every single DIVVY bike trip](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Trips/fg6s-gzvg) since 2013 are also online. Today, the data portal has nearly 90 million rows of data

This past month, the city&#8217;s tech leaders spoke at several conferences:

  * Chicago&#8217;s Chief Information Officer, Brenna Berman, [spoke on a panel](http://statescoop.com/do-cities-need-a-point-person-to-lead-innovation) with former Maryland Governor Martin O&#8217;Malley at the [Smart Cities Innovation Summit](http://smartcitiesinnovation.com/).
  * In May, Chicago&#8217;s Chief Data Officer, Tom Schenk, spoke at the National Academy of Science&#8217;s &#8220;[Workshop on Big Data and Analytics for Infectious Disease Research, Operations, and Policy](http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Activities/PublicHealth/MicrobialThreats/2016-May-10.aspx)&#8220;. This month, a recording of the presentation was posted and available below. [Schenk&#8217;s opinion piece](http://hosting.fluidbook.com/open-resource-magazine-02/?lang=en#/26) on how data will change the face of cities also appeared in print.
