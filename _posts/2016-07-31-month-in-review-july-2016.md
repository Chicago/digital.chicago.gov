Chicago finished another phase on its commitment for paperless permits. You can now [apply for business permits completely online](http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-chicago-business-license-application-online-bsi-20160701-story.html) with no need to follow-up at City Hall.

But it&#8217;s when a small start-up [used the code](http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/municipal-analytics-the-startup-way-873) for other governments is when it got interesting.

The city&#8217;s Chief Data Officer, Tom Schenk, spoke at Amazon Web Service&#8217;s DC Summit about OpenGrid and how it helps provide greater transparency and improves city operations.

City of Chicago is big user and producer of open source software, including for the R statistical suite. Watch one of the [city&#8217;s data scientists gave a talk at the worldwide R user meeting](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/city-of-chicago-user-2016/) on the city analytics projects.

Another month means [another version of OpenGrid](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/now-available-opengrid-v1-1-0/) is available for the public. This month, the release includes some usability improvements and some technical API improvements. For developers, you can [download OpenGrid v1.1.0 from the GitHub page](https://github.com/Chicago/opengrid/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

AT&T named [Chicago one of of the spotlight cities](http://about.att.com/story/launches_smart_cities_framework.html) for AT&T&#8217;s smart city framework. As part of that, AT&T will be the wireless network used by the [Array of Things](http://arrayofthings.github.io/) to carry data from each sensor to the open data portal.
