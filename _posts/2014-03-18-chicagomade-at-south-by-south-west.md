Every year, 49,000 people from around the world come to take part in South by Southwest. This year Chicago made sure it was not left out.

The Mayor started out by attending the launch of Chicago Based [Inventables](https://www.inventables.com/) new design platform called [Easel](http://www.easel.com/), which is an easy-to-use, online maker tool allowing anyone to design their creations from home. It’s as easy as point, click, and create. It only took the Mayor five minutes to design this [bottle opener](https://twitter.com/zkaplan/status/443419698646880257/photo/1).

And we brought [our friends](http://www.chicagomade.us/makers). From hackers and engineers like Harper Reed, to major musical artists like Chance the Rapper, the Chicago Made booth had something for innovators, inventors, entrepreneurs, artists and story tellers alike. It was all about showcasing what Chicago is made of, and the kinds of amazing people, ideas and creations that emerge from our city.

Did you know that only 5% of technology startups are founded by women?  This week we also announced the creation of a new tech incubator called [FEMtech](http://www.1871.com/1871-makes-commitment-to-support-women-led-startups-with-new-femtech-incubator/), which will increase opportunities for women-owned tech businesses and startups.
