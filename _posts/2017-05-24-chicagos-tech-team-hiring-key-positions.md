They will play a key role in designing the future of the city&#8217;s architecture, including an increasing footprint in cloud computing services.

The technology team has had a deep commitment to using open source software and will be expanding the use of Postgres as the enterprise database solution for city systems. The position will work with on-premise and cloud-based Postgres databases and helping migration some from Oracle to Postgres. You&#8217;ll work with a team of highly-experienced DBAs and reshape the city&#8217;s database platform.
