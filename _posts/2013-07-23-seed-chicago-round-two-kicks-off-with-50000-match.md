Seed Chicago, the [city’s collaboration with Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/pages/seedchicago) to fund impactful small business and community development projects, is back for round two! The new projects include everything from a South Chicago arts-and-crafts fair to a book highlighting into the unique cultural offerings of each Chicago neighborhood.

For this round, Chicago-based MillerCoors will be using its $50,000 matching fund to provide selected projects with a dollar-for-dollar match of up to $5,000, provided they meet their Kickstarter funding goal. Tom Long, the CEO of MillerCoors, is excited to be involved and says he hopes that Seed Chicago can fuel economic empowerment across Chicago’s neighborhoods.

Supported by [Accion Chicago](http://www.accionchicago.org/) and [Local Initiatives Support Corporation](http://www.lisc.org/), World Business Chicago has selected the second round of outstanding projects that are making direct and positive impacts in their communities. By focusing on economic expansion on a community level, Seed Chicago allows creators of these projects to target the needs specific to their neighborhood and residents to fund projects that will see a direct impact in their local area.
