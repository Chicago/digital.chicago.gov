[OpenGrid](https://chicago.opengrid.io) lets residents and visitors of Chicago navigate the city&#8217;s data based on where they are or where they are interested in exploring. Now, you can share those maps with others, like [restaurants failing a food inspection in the past month](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22Restaurants%20passing%20initial%20inspection%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22food_inspections%22,%22filters%22:%7B%22condition%22:%22AND%22,%22rules%22:%5B%7B%22id%22:%22results%22,%22field%22:%22results%22,%22type%22:%22string%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22equal%22,%22value%22:%22Fail%22%7D,%7B%22id%22:%22facility_type%22,%22field%22:%22facility_type%22,%22type%22:%22string%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22equal%22,%22value%22:%22Restaurant%22%7D,%7B%22id%22:%22inspection_type%22,%22field%22:%22inspection_type%22,%22type%22:%22string%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22not_equal%22,%22value%22:%22Initial%22%7D,%7B%22id%22:%22inspection_date%22,%22field%22:%22inspection_date%22,%22type%22:%22date%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22greater%22,%22value%22:%221%20month%20ago%22%7D%5D%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523DC143C%22,%22opacity%22:%2285%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22_id%22:%7B%22$oid%22:%225601c86c94375920f8eb2e0c%22%7D,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22within%22,%22boundary%22:%22%22%7D%7D&run=true&_=1023076694696), [new business licenses issues within a few blocks from you](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22Street%20Closures%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22business_licenses%22,%22filters%22:%7B%22condition%22:%22AND%22,%22rules%22:%5B%7B%22id%22:%22date_issued%22,%22field%22:%22date_issued%22,%22type%22:%22date%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22greater%22,%22value%22:%221%20month%20ago%22%7D%5D%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523FF8C00%22,%22opacity%22:%2280%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22_id%22:%7B%22$oid%22:%225601c86c94375920f8eb2e0c%22%7D,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22near%22,%22boundary%22:%22_me%22,%22value%22:null,%22maxRadius%22:%220.25%22,%22maxRadiusUnit%22:%22miles%22%7D%7D&run=true&_=1417946465062), and [potholes filled within the past week](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22Street%20Closures%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22311_service_requests_pot_holes_reported%22,%22filters%22:%7B%22condition%22:%22AND%22,%22rules%22:%5B%7B%22id%22:%22completion_date%22,%22field%22:%22completion_date%22,%22type%22:%22date%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22greater%22,%22value%22:%221%20week%20ago%22%7D,%7B%22id%22:%22status%22,%22field%22:%22status%22,%22type%22:%22string%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22equal%22,%22value%22:%22Completed%22%7D%5D%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523CD5C5C%22,%22opacity%22:%2280%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22_id%22:%7B%22$oid%22:%225601c86c94375920f8eb2e0c%22%7D,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22within%22,%22boundary%22:%22citywide%22,%22value%22:%22chicago%22%7D%7D&run=true&_=237155847710).

Last week, the newest version of OpenGrid supported the ability to share maps with others. After you run a search, you can share the URL with anyone. On desktops, copy and paste the URL from the web browser. On a mobile device, such as iPhone, iPad, or Android, you can click on the share button.

Combine [relative dates](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/now-available-opengrid-v1-1-0/), such as &#8220;today&#8221;, &#8220;yesterday&#8221; or &#8220;1 month&#8221; ago in your searches to always get the most relevant time frame.  For instance, you can look at ordinance violations from [yesterday](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22building_violations%22,%22filters%22:%7B%22condition%22:%22AND%22,%22rules%22:%5B%7B%22id%22:%22violation_date%22,%22field%22:%22violation_date%22,%22type%22:%22date%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22between%22,%22value%22:%5B%22yesterday%22,%22today%22%5D%7D%5D%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523DC143C%22,%22opacity%22:%2280%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22within%22,%22boundary%22:%22_map-extent%22%7D%7D&loc=41.88432,-87.65211,14&run=true&_=86852812888), [last week](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22building_violations%22,%22filters%22:%7B%22condition%22:%22AND%22,%22rules%22:%5B%7B%22id%22:%22violation_date%22,%22field%22:%22violation_date%22,%22type%22:%22date%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22between%22,%22value%22:%5B%221%20week%20ago%22,%22today%22%5D%7D%5D%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523DC143C%22,%22opacity%22:%2280%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22within%22,%22boundary%22:%22_map-extent%22%7D%7D&loc=41.88432,-87.65211,14&run=true&_=921000826135), or [last month](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22building_violations%22,%22filters%22:%7B%22condition%22:%22AND%22,%22rules%22:%5B%7B%22id%22:%22violation_date%22,%22field%22:%22violation_date%22,%22type%22:%22date%22,%22input%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22between%22,%22value%22:%5B%221%20month%20ago%22,%22today%22%5D%7D%5D%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523DC143C%22,%22opacity%22:%2280%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22within%22,%22boundary%22:%22_map-extent%22%7D%7D&loc=41.88432,-87.65211,14&run=true&_=326831006109). You can also customize the location of where you&#8217;re looking for data. It can be in a specific ward, like [Ward 42](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22building_permits%22,%22filters%22:%7B%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523FFD700%22,%22opacity%22:%2280%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22within%22,%22boundary%22:%22ward%22,%22value%22:%22Ward%2042%22%7D%7D&run=true&_=944653665809), a [custom drawn area](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22building_permits%22,%22filters%22:%7B%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523FFD700%22,%22opacity%22:%2280%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22within%22,%22boundary%22:%22_drawn-extent%22,%22value%22:%7B%22type%22:%22FeatureCollection%22,%22features%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22Feature%22,%22properties%22:%7B%7D,%22geometry%22:%7B%22type%22:%22Polygon%22,%22coordinates%22:%5B%5B%5B-87.68291473388673,41.90917597761326%5D,%5B-87.68308639526369,41.909303728668824%5D,%5B-87.68291473388673,41.909303728668824%5D,%5B-87.67330169677736,41.88822134553516%5D,%5B-87.67330169677736,41.88822134553516%5D,%5B-87.64549255371094,41.89077715660123%5D,%5B-87.64909744262697,41.887837965055716%5D,%5B-87.65167236328126,41.88592102814744%5D,%5B-87.66935348510744,41.87505729922759%5D,%5B-87.66935348510744,41.87505729922759%5D,%5B-87.64411926269531,41.85818290622204%5D,%5B-87.64411926269531,41.85818290622204%5D,%5B-87.67433166503908,41.867132002656525%5D,%5B-87.67433166503908,41.867132002656525%5D,%5B-87.68325805664064,41.84693083657544%5D,%5B-87.68325805664064,41.84693083657544%5D,%5B-87.69372940063478,41.86828250989843%5D,%5B-87.69372940063478,41.86828250989843%5D,%5B-87.70832061767578,41.86189054099241%5D,%5B-87.72068023681642,41.85652079326776%5D,%5B-87.71141052246094,41.86585363699297%5D,%5B-87.69956588745117,41.87710237754347%5D,%5B-87.69956588745117,41.87710237754347%5D,%5B-87.72050857543945,41.89052158009614%5D,%5B-87.72050857543945,41.89052158009614%5D,%5B-87.69390106201173,41.88822134553516%5D,%5B-87.69390106201173,41.88822134553516%5D,%5B-87.68291473388673,41.90917597761326%5D%5D%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%7D%7D&run=true&_=1208501764877), or the [entire city](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/#/query?q=%7B%22name%22:%22%22,%22owner%22:%22NoAuth%22,%22spec%22:%5B%7B%22dataSetId%22:%22building_permits%22,%22filters%22:%7B%7D,%22rendition%22:%7B%22color%22:%22%2523FFD700%22,%22opacity%22:%2280%22,%22size%22:%226%22%7D%7D%5D,%22sharedWith%22:%7B%22users%22:%5B%5D,%22groups%22:%5B%5D%7D,%22isCommon%22:false,%22autoRefresh%22:false,%22refreshInterval%22:%2230%22,%22geoFilter%22:%7B%22boundaryType%22:%22within%22,%22boundary%22:%22citywide%22,%22value%22:%22chicago%22%7D%7D&run=true&_=114228300762).

More sharing features will be rolled out in the future. In the meantime, you can provide feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO), via [email](mailto:developers@cityofchicago.org), or by [reporting an issue](https://github.com/Chicago/opengrid) on GitHub.
