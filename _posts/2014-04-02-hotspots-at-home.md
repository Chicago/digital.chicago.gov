If CPL is chosen for this grant, the pilot program would allow patrons at pilot branches in neighborhoods with extremely low in-home broadband use to check out an Internet Hotspot for three weeks, allowing them access to the Internet at home. Be sure to use the hashtag #NewsMatters when sharing with your networks!  Winners of the grant will be announced on June 23rd.

For community members without an Internet capable device, CPL would simultaneously launch a pilot computer-lending program, in which specially-tagged and outfitted laptops or tablets would be loaned in combination with the Hotspots.

Chicago Public Library patrons of all ages come to the library to use the internet for homework help, job searches, and to create email accounts. The Hotspot at Home program would be more convenient for patrons, as well as increase Chicago’s digital skill development and engagement in online communities.

This will also enable CPL to actively support the [City’s Tech Plan](http://techplan.cityofchicago.org/), which hopes to accelerate job creation, improve the quality of life for all Chicagoans, and provide increased digital access and skills.
