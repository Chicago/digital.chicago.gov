[OpenGrid](digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/opengrid-explore-your-community/) was launched almost [one year ago](digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/opengrid-explore-your-community/). Since that time, users have been providing feedback on how the platform can be even easier to navigate their neighborhoods. Over the past few months, the team has continued to focus on bettering the user experience and making data more easily accessible to the user as they navigate around the map. Users have told us that it took too many clicks to see data. For instance, users would need to click the “Find Data” to anytime they moved the map to get updated data.

The latest version of OpenGrid will now refresh each time the map is moved. You will no longer need to manually re-run your search when you want to see data for a new area. Each time the map moves or you zoom in or out, OpenGrid will instantaneously refresh with the newest data. Simply choose the data you want to see, click &#8220;Find Data&#8221; once, and you can explore Chicago.

The number of clicks needed to retrieve data has been significantly reduced in the last few months, making it easier to get data but still allowing powerful searching across over two dozen data sets.

## **OpenGrid in 2017**

New features will be rolled out to OpenGrid team through 2017.  In the next few month we are aiming to add some new features:

  * Implement bubble plots on the map—The bubbles will vary in sized based on a numeric value associated with queried data. Consider, plotting the potholes in the city. It would be useful to be able to plot the site of the circle to correspond to the number of potholes filled on the block.
  * Display data with parent-child relationships
  * Graph time-series data
  * Improve the ability to share queries

If you’re interested in collaborating with the city, you can take a look at the [past meeting notes](https://www.github.com/Chicago/opengrid/wiki) on the project’s Wiki. While the source code is online, the [project’s documentation](https://docs.opengrid.io/) gives a concise overview for developers. Likewise, look at the [instructions for contributors](https://github.com/Chicago/opengrid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help us run a useful, collaborative project.
