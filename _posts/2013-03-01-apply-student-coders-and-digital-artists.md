For the first time in Chicago’s history, we’re recruiting student web developers and designers to take part in the newly launched Mayor Emanuel’s Summer Technology Fellowship. The Mayor is looking for “new energy, ideas, and enthusiasm to City Hall” and creating a space for students to learn from technology leaders in Chicago.

“Chicago is a digital destination,” the Mayor said. “Our startup and technology sectors are flourishing and today’s innovators and tomorrow’s leaders should look to our city as a place to launch their careers and ideas.”

Here’s an idea of what we’re looking for:

  * Engineers – Backend developers who want to build things (Java and/or Python), and data scientists looking to leverage Chicago data to improve performance and drive analytics.
  * Designers – visualize data, improve user experience, make information understandable and develop front-end applications.****

The Mayor’s Technology Fellows will jump into existing projects and will be asked to building new solutions to better serve Chicagoans, right alongside our city’s digital leaders. Applications are due by March 31, and the program runs 11 weeks from June 17, 2013 to August 30, 2013.
