Mayor Emanuel is announcing a $7 billion, three year infrastructure program, Building a New Chicago, which is one of the largest investments in infrastructure in the City&#8217;s history. The program will touch nearly every aspect of the city&#8217;s infrastructure network and create more than 30,000 jobs over the next three years.

Building a New Chicago is one of the most comprehensive infrastructure plans in Chicago&#8217;s history, involving an unprecedented level of coordination between City Hall, multiple city departments and sister agencies, private sector utilities, and the public.

These investments will not involve taxes increases.
