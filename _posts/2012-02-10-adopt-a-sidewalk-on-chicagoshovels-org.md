  The &#8220;Adopt-A-Sidewalk&#8221; web app feature allows neighbors to connect with each other to help shovel sidewalks and offers a platform for sharing resources. Neighbors &#8220;adopt-a-sidewalk&#8221; near their home by &#8220;claiming&#8221; it on an interactive map and will be able to see at-a-glance which sidewalks are claimed and have the option to connect with their neighbors to help keep their sidewalks clear. One section is powered by www.OhSoWe.com, which allows neighbors to share shovels and snow blowers. This is the first time the City has created a sidewalk dataset, which is used to visualize sidewalks on the map. Users of &#8220;Adopt-a-Sidewalk&#8221; can help improve this data by reporting addresses on the map that appear to be missing or incorrect&#8230;
