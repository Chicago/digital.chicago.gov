From smart phones to digital cameras, from Facebook to Google, technology is a central part of our kids&#8217; lives today. We&#8217;re happy to announce that Best Buy is now sponsoring [Chicago City of Learning](http://chicagocityoflearning.org/) programs designed to build our students&#8217; technology skills through fun, interactive workshops and activities.

“The Chicago City of Learning program continues to engage our kids, opening the doors to a variety of learning opportunities across the city,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “The additional resources provided by Best Buy’s Geek Squad Academy will allow Chicago’s youth to explore a future in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields. This will help prepare our children with the skills and education they need for college and a successful career.”

Hands-on projects afford children and teens to work with everything from traditional craft materials to state-of-the-art technology. Through the sponsorship, participating CCOL outlets will afford Best Buy Geek Squad Academy to teach Chicago’s youth about the latest technology that will set them up for future career and college success. Geek Squad Academy will provide tech experts to engage kids with activities such as robotics, 3D printing and audio and video production.
