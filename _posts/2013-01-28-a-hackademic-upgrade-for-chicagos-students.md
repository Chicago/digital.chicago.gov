Whenever they hear “there’s an app for that,” students should be able to think “there’s a career in building that app.”

It’s no secret that as more and more companies expand their digital departments, the career outlook for web developers continues to rise. With that in mind, Mayor Emanuel [announced an innovative program](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2013/january_2013/mayor_emanuel_unveilsinnovativepartnershipwiththestarterleagueto.html) to teach Chicago students how to code in a partnership between Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) and Chicago startup [The Starter League.](http://www.starterleague.com/)

Located in [1871](http://www.1871.com/2012/09/introducing-the-starter-league/), The Starter League will provide cutting-edge web development courses that will reach more 2,000 Chicago students in 2014. Students who are interested in technology but don’t have any experience can expect to understand the basics of programming principles. The Starter League will train CPS and CCC teachers and help them design a forward-thinking curriculum for high school and City Colleges students, increasing their access to the skills they need to succeed in the booming Internet industry.

“International companies and local startups alike look to Chicago as a city with top talent,” the Mayor said. “Cutting-edge partnerships like this, as well as our expanding College to Careers program, work to help our students succeed and maintain our city’s status as a competitive destination.”

The new CPS and CCC curriculum will focus on teaching HTML, CSS, and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) for web development. Ruby on Rails is ideal for beginning coders and scalable to power the world’s most robust websites. It is also open source and free for anyone to use. Best of all, it was created right here in Chicago.

We’re excited to see what our students can do.
