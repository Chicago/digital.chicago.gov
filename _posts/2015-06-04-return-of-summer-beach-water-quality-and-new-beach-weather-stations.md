With the opening of swimming season, the Chicago Park District water sensors at Lake Michigan beaches are live again and <a title="Beach Water Sensors" href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku" target="_blank">streaming</a> to the data portal hourly.

That dataset has a partner dataset, beginning this year, <a title="Beach Weather Stations" href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75" target="_blank">Beach Weather Stations</a>. The Park District places land-based sensors at some beaches to measure air temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, barometric pressure, and sunlight. The data collected are also streamed to the data portal hourly.

Finally, in order to facilitate geographic analysis of the water and weather data, we have published the <a title="Water and Weather Sensor Locations" href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/g3ip-u8rb" target="_blank">locations </a>of the beaches where the sensors are in operation. Â Note that not all sensors are active at all times so locations sometimes will be listed that are not currently providing data.
