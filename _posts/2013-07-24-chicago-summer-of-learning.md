This year, Mayor Emanuel launched Chicago Summer of Learning, the first coordinated effort to offering young people of all ages across the city access to high-quality summer learning opportunities. Partnered with over 100 organizations, this initiative has all of Chicago coming together to support young people in exploring the themes of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) learning throughout the summer. Summer is no longer about losing educational gains; it&#8217;s about making them!
