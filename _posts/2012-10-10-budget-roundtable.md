Mayor Rahm Emanuel has held a series of conversations with residents across the city on how to address Chicago&#8217;s budget challenges. This discussion took place at Cocula Mexican Restaurant with local Latino business owners, residents, and community organizers to discuss the issues affecting them and how they can be addressed in the 2013 budget.
