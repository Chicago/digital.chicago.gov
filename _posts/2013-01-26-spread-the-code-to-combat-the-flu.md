Dr. Julia Morita hosted a twitter chat to help better prepare Chicagoans to tackle the flu. Mayor Emanuel joined the conversation as well. See the chat via <a title="Chicagoist" href="http://chicagoist.com/2013/01/11/recapping_the_city_health_departmen.php" target="_blank">Chicagoist&#8217;s excellent recap</a>.

As cities across the nation find new ways to help combat the flu this season, Chicago is sharing one remedy with our friends in other cities.  At the start of the season, the Chicago Department of Public health teamed up with local developer Tom Kompare to [launch an interactive map](http://codeforamerica.org/2013/01/17/flu-app-spreads/ "flu app spreads") to help connect Chicagoans to vaccination locations. The app itself is designed to help users find nearby clinics that offer free flu shots by entering their addresses.

After Boston declared a public health emergency over this year&#8217;s flu, they saw that our flu map could lend a hand. [Less than 36 hours later](http://flushot.newurbanmechanics.org/ "Boston Flu Map") ,  Boston&#8217;s version of the flu map was deployed . Working with Code for America, we made the code that powers the app available to other cities [like Philadelphia](http://apps.phillyopen.org/flu-shot-map/ "Philly Flu Map") to build their own maps.  Thanks to our friends at Code for America for helping to [connect the dots](http://codeforamerica.org/2013/01/17/flu-app-spreads/ "Flu App spreads").
