  Mayor Rahm Emanuel officially opened protected bike lanes on Dearborn Street through the Loop, the first two-way bike route with dedicated bicycle traffic signals in Chicago. The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) has constructed approximately 30 miles of new bicycle lanes in neighborhoods across the city this year, and upgraded another nine miles of older bike lanes with new paint. Since Mayor Emanuel took office in May 2011, CDOT has built more than 58 miles of new bikeways and refreshed another 20 miles of older bike lanes.Â  More than 30 miles of the new bikeways are protected with barriers or buffers, keeping pace with the mayor&#8217;s commitment to build 100 such miles in his first term in office.
