The first Array of Things sensor went online on September 1st and since then, 3 more sensors have gone online.Â Array of Things was deployed with a commitment to transparency and today we&#8217;ve launched an [interactive map](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Array-of-Things-Locations-Map/2dng-xkng) of the installed and planned sensors to be installed on Chicago&#8217;s Open Data Portal.

You can download the [raw data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Array-of-Things-Locations/6rq2-yx28) behind the map from the portal as well.

Array of Things will continue to expand throughout the next couple of years for a total of 500 sensors. Later this year, after the data from the sensors are validated, data will be streamed online and in the open so researchers, citizen scientists, and the curious can analyze the data.
