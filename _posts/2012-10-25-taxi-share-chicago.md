This app gives you the ability to easily and efficiently share a taxi with others who are going to the same general destination. First, type in your destination, the app then locates your route and shows you others ( also using the app) who are headed in the same general direction. By using the messaging feature on the app, you can then communicate with them and plan to share or pick them up on the way.
