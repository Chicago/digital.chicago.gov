Over the past few weeks, Mayor Emanuel has been traveling across the City talking to groups and engaging in a direct, personal dialogue about their concerns and ideas to help balance the City&#8217;s 2013 budget while preserving services most precious to Chicago&#8217;s children and families. By hosting small roundtable discussions, the Mayor received some constructive feedback from residents all across Chicago that helped inform important decisions about this year&#8217;s budget.
