Principals and school leaders explain the engaging, full-day activities at over 147 Children First school sites that are available to Chicago Public Schools students as the CTU chooses to delay ending their strike. There are over 450 sites in neighborhoods across the city, including schools, parks, libraries and faith and community centers.
