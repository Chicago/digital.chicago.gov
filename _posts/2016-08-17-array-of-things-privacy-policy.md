The [Array of Things](https://arrayofthings.github.io/) has reached another milestone.  This week, the final Privacy and Governance Policies were published on the project website.  The final policies, along with detailed responses to 80 comments and the engagement report, can be found at <https://arrayofthings.github.io/privacypolicy.html>   This step in the AoT project invited the public to provide comments and ask questions about how the data collected by the sensor nodes will be protected and managed.  They were provided with several means to engage with the City, University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory.  The project partners have responded to each comment and shared all of the details of the engagement process, along with lessons learned.  This information will serve as a foundation for future public engagement as the Array of Things nodes are installed across the City.
