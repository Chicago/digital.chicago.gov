Mayor Emanuel believes those who have spent their lives working for Chicago deserve a secure future with a reasonable retirement. However, our system is broken, and if nothing changes, both taxpayers and the retiring city employees will suffer. We must take action now, to prevent skyrocketing taxes, drastic reductions in City services, or even the bankrupting of our pension system. The City of Chicago needs everyone to come together immediately to solve this growing problem.
