&#8220;Student success is core to our mission in education. We believe that continued investment in STEM education is the driver for creating a skilled workforce that will grow and sustain our national economy,” said Sig Behrens from Microsoft.

“These schools will focus on skills graduates need in the modern workforce and Information Technology industry.  Students will also have the option to earn college credits and complete a six-year program with an associate’s degree,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

As it turns out, an international technology giant and City Hall have the same mission.

Mayor Emanuel announced in late February that Chicago Public School students will have the opportunity to attend five Early College STEM schools that will prepare them for college and future careers, a collaborative effort between City Colleges of Chicago, Chicago Public Schools, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft Corporation, Motorola Solutions, and Verizon Wireless.

Students that participate in the program will gain tech chops and develop career readiness while earning college credit. Each student can graduate with their high school diploma and have the opportunity to earn an Associate of Science degree in computer science or an Associate in Applied Science in information technology. With those degrees, the student can then continue their education and earn that bachelor’s degree and work for Chicago’s booming tech scene.
