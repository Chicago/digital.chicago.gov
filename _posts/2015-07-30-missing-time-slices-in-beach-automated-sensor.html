<p>Some hourly updates for the<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku"> Beach Water Quality - Automated Sensors</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75">Beach Weather Stations - Automated Sensors</a> datasets have been failing since yesterday. The Chicago Park District is aware of the problem and is working to fix it.</p><p>Unlike some datasets, the nature of how these datasets are updated means the missing time slices will not be filled in, even after the underlying problem is fixed.</p>
