Chicago Public Library and Google Chicago are partnering to bring the latest innovation in STEM education to Chicago: Finch Robots! Thanks to Google’s donation of 500 Finch Robots, anyone with a library card can check out one of the fun, hands-on robots to learn the basics of computer coding.

The easy-to-use Finch Robots are programmable devices that can move, make noises, light up, and even draw, allowing students to bring computer coding to life. Using the Finch, students as young as eight years old can learn the basics of coding in over a dozen programming languages and environments in a fun, interactive way.

Offering Finch Robots at Chicago Public Library is another step towards Mayor Emanuel’s goal of providing STEM education for Chicagoans of all ages and making 21<sup>st</sup> century job skills like computer programming accessible across the city. The robots can be checked out individually or in packs of five, making it easy for teachers or community organizations working with larger groups to take advantage of the state-of-the-art technology.

Any adult patron of the Library can check out a robot, either at one of the six CPL locations where the robots are housed, or through the Library’s holds system using [chipublib.org](http://www.chipublib.org/).

Lesson plans and tutorials for the Finch can be found on the [finchrobot.com](http://www.finchrobot.com/) website. For more information, check out this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Imq5lo3HuE) to see the Finch in action!
