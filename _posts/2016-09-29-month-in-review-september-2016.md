### White House highlights Chicago data and technology initiatives

  * A[rray of Things are being installed](http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/September-2016/The-Array-of-Things-Is-Coming-to-Chicago-and-the-World/) across Chicago to collect environmental, noise, density and other data that is designed to improve the city and is limited to protect individual privacy. The data will be made publicly available online. You can now [follow along](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/interactive-array-of-things-map-now-live/) when new nodes are installed on the open data portal. [See a map](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Array-of-Things-Locations-Map/2dng-xkng) of new locations.
  * [Digging for the next innovation](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/digging-for-the-next-innovation/)! An underground utility is struck every 60 seconds in the United States, causing billions in damage. Chicago partnered with [UI Labs&#8217; City Digital](http://www.citydigital.org/) and a consortium to build and pilot new technology to scan and map underground infrastructure. Take a look at the video to show how this information can be browsed in the future.

  * The [White House highlighted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/26/fact-sheet-announcing-over-80-million-new-federal-investment-and) Array of Things and the Underground Mapping project as examples of innovative programs as part of their $80 million expansion of investments in the Smart Cities Initiative.

### Redesigned websites ready for public feedback

  * Chicago [launched a pilot](https://cityofchicago-v2.demo.socrata.com/) of the next open data portal and is looking for feedback from users. Test it and drop a line to <dataportal@cityofchicago.org>.

  * The beta of the data portal was tested with groups at [ChiHackNight](http://www.chihacknight.org) and [Smart Chicago&#8217;s Civic User Testing (CUT) Group](http://www.cutgroup.org). Both tech-savvy and casual users piloted the site and provided their feedback directly to the open data team, who will be adjusting the site for a better experience.

  * Chicago&#8217;s [Annual Financial Analysis report](http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/open-source-tools-meet-the-municipal-budget-office-903) went digital for the first time this year. The report was assembled using open source and available tools, suck as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub, forgoing more costlier methods.
  * Chicago has released a half-dozen APIs in the past 5 years. A [beta of a new developer portal](http://dev.cityofchicago.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) is now available to connect developers and researchers with documentation and updates to those services. You can reach out to <developers@cityofchicago.org> to provide your thoughts.

### Open Data Portal continues to expand

  * Dozens of [new education-related data sets](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/path-to-school-dozens-of-new-cps-maps-now-online/) are on the open data portal. See maps of school locations for the past 10 years, school profiles, and much more.
  * [Business Activity](http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/business-activities-in-the-business-licenses-dataset/) codes &#8212; which describe what a business does &#8212; has been added to the open data portal&#8217;s Business Licenses data set.

### Chicago is leveraging open data as part of it&#8217;s predictive analytics

Chicago&#8217;s Chief Data Officer spoke with [Manhattan Institute&#8217;s Aaron Renn](https://soundcloud.com/aaronrenn/using-open-data-and-civic-analytics-to-improve-public-services-in-chicago-with-tom-schenk) on the intersection of open data and predictive analytics in a recent podcast:
