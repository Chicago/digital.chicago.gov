<img loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-1302" style="margin: 9px;" title="Broadband" src="http://digital.cityofchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Broadband1.png" alt="" width="200" height="144" srcset="https://digital.cityofchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Broadband1.png 450w, https://digital.cityofchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Broadband1-300x215.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /> A 21st century digital infrastructure is critical to supporting Chicago’s long-term growth, job creation, global competitiveness, and overall quality of life. Mayor Emanuel is committed to making the investments required to ensure that Chicago is prepared to meet the demands of the modern economy and position Chicago as one of the most connected cities in the world.

This is where you come in.

The Broadband Challenge opens a dialogue with the public, inviting all Chicagoans to get creative and explore the possibilities of how and where to build this infrastructure and what a globally leading digital network allows us to accomplish. This conversation will inform the way the City moves forward with its broadband development strategy. Any individual, company, student, nonprofit organization, or community group is encouraged to respond, either informally through this website or as part of the formal responses the City is soliciting through a Request for Information.

## We need your ideas

The Broadband Challenge invites the public to submit ideas and insights on:

<div class="textbox">
  <p>
    1. How the City can best make use of its existing broadband infrastructure and potential uses for future expansion of high-speed broadband access citywide. So let’s fill-in-the blank here:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      “If I had ultra-high-speed broadband at home I could….”
    </li>
    <li>
      “If my school/church/community group had blazing fast internet service we could…”
    </li>
    <li>
      “If my company had gigabit speed fiber we could…”
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    To submit your thoughts on how the City could use faster broadband service, send your answers to these questions, along with any general comments to <a href="mailto:chicagobroadband@cityofchicago.org">chicagobroadband@cityofchicago.org</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="textbox">
  <p>
    2. How and where the City should make these critical infrastructure improvements. The City has released a Request for Information that seeks to engage private companies, universities, and other organizations to accomplish 3 main goals:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Build a world-class broadband infrastructure with gigabit speed fiber
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide affordable, reliable broadband service in underserved and disadvantaged areas
    </li>
    <li>
      Establish free wireless networks in parks and public spaces across the City
    </li>
  </ul>
