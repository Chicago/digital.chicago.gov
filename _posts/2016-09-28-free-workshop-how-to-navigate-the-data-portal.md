This Friday, Chicago&#8217;s open data team will be presenting a free workshop on how to use the city&#8217;s [open data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org). The data portal contains a wide range of data, from [liquor licenses](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Licenses-Current-Liquor-and-Public-Places/nrmj-3kcf), [building permits](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Permits/ydr8-5enu), [incidents of crimes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present-Map/c4ep-ee5m), [school profiles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Profile-Information-/8i6r-et8s), and much more. You will see how you can search and find data related to your community and the ability to make maps and graphs using this freely accessible data. You don&#8217;t need to be an IT professional or a researcher to work with data from the portal and this workshop will help connect you with data about your school, business, and community.

Register for the event [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/chicago-open-data-how-to-navigate-the-citys-data-portal-tickets-27386588022?aff=estw). It&#8217;s free and open to the public.

If you cannot make the workshop, you can see other tutorials on the data portal from the team&#8217;s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChicagoITDept/playlists):
