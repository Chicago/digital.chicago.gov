The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) is excited to launch a new app called [FoodBorne Chicago](http://foodborne.smartchicagoapps.org/), which was developed in collaboration with the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/).

This simple tool allows residents to report a food poisoning incident through 311. You identify the restaurant, the date and time you attended, your symptoms, and press send. The information is sent directly to CDPH and, if warranted, an inspection team is sent to the restaurant in question and the City will let you know via email. You can also track your claim on [Service Tracker](http://servicetracker.cityofchicago.org/).

The app will also regularly scan related tweets for the Smart Chicago Collaborative team’s review. The team will @reply back in order to send people to the app—all part of our efforts to make connecting with city services more efficient and as easy as possible.

Why foodborne illness? It is a public health issue, and unreported cases have a potential impact on our communities. CDPH receives roughly 5800 complaints per year, leading to 174 restaurant investigations for suspected food poisoning. However, as many as 45% of foodborne illness cases go unreported, largely because residents may be unaware that they can file a complaint, much less how to file a complaint. Now you can file, track, and follow your claim thanks to this innovative new tool.
