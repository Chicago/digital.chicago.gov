For [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org), Chicago will play host to three separate events. The first is the [ChicagoMigraHack](http://www.chicagomigrahack.com/), a hackathon focused on the issue of immigration. The second event will be a [youth focused hackathon at the Adler Planetarium.](http://civichack.adlerplanetarium.org/) And finally, there will be an assortment of different civic hacking activities at [Hack for Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/OpenGovChicago/events/119353342/) hosted at the entrepreneurial coworking space [1871](http://1871.com). They’ll also be a [Civic Hacking 101 class](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cqantb3id5ap5t39sahdhe6u920) streamed nationally to help orient people who are new to civic hacking.

To say that Chicago does a lot of civic hacking events would be an understatement. For the last year, civic minded web developers, data scientists, designers, and community organizers have gathered at [1871](http://1871.com) each Tuesday for the [Chicago OpenGov Hack Night](http://opengovhacknight.eventbrite.com/). Recently, the City [hosted a hackathon at Google Chicago](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/using-the-new-clearpath-api-to-help-communities-interact-with-the-chicago-police-department/) in order to find creative ways to use the new public safety [ClearPath API](http://api1.chicagopolice.org/clearpath/documentation). Part of the reason for all this activity is that the City of Chicago has released a [ton of open data](http://data.cityofchicago.org) that helps fuel civic app development. (931 data sets and counting!)

So, for [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org) it only made sense to have multiple events. These events were helped to be put together by a variety of partners including the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://smartchicagocollaborative.org), [Institute of Justice & Journalism](http://ijj.org), [Adler Planetarium](http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/), [Cibola](http://buildcibola.org), [The MacArthur Foundation](http://www.macfound.org/), the [Chicago Architecture Foundation](http://www.architecture.org/page.aspx?pid=183), [Mikva Challenge](http://www.mikvachallenge.org/), [Center for Evidence-Based Mentoring](http://umbmentoring.org/), [Hive Chicago](http://hivechicago.org), [Free Spirit Media](http://www.freespiritmedia.org/), [Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/), [Open City Apps](http://opencityapps.org), and the [City of Chicago](http://digital.cityofchicago.org).

While hackathons are great for organizing around civic issues and getting together to solve problems using technology, there often isn&#8217;t enough time to actually build apps based on the ideas being generated. That’s why we’re encouraging participants to continue the ideas that start at National Day of Civic Hacking by attending the weekly [OpenGov Hack Nights.](http://opengovhacknight.eventbrite.com/)
