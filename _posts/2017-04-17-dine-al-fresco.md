Much as we take pride in our toughness through Midwestern winters, the real joy of living in this city [is](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Bike-Routes/3w5d-sru8) [our](http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/events/) [Chicago](https://www.mlb.com/whitesox) [summers](https://www.mlb.com/cubs).  High on the list of the summertime pleasures is outdoor dining at restaurants that offer it and finding such restaurants just got a bit easier.

Our new [Sidewalk Cafe Permits dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Sidewalk-Cafe-Permits/nxj5-ix6z) lists those businesses that have obtained the necessary [permit](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/bacp/supp_info/sidewalk_cafe_current_permits.html) to offer outdoor restaurant seating on the public way.  For those interested in long-term trends, the [full datase](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Sidewalk-Cafe-Permits/nxj5-ix6z)t shows permits back to 2001.  However, if you just want to find a place to eat tonight, you will be more interested in the list of [current permits](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Sidewalk-Cafe-Permits-Current/qnjv-hj2q).  Better yet, look at them on a [map](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Sidewalk-Cafe-Permits-Current-Map/mqmh-p6ud):



Permits are valid from March 1 to December 1 and more are added almost every day.  So, check back often and  _bon appétit_!
