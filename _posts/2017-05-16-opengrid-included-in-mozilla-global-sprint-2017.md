OpenGrid is an [open-source](https://www.github.com/opengrid) site that provides residents access to data about their community in a single map. Residents, researchers, and non-profits can use the data to find historical information on crimes, business licenses, building permits to real-time information on their phones or desktop. It’s mission is to improve Chicagoans’ ability to meaningfully use open data beyond the capacity of current data portals by providing residents and City leaders a way to visually understand complex municipal data. The site was launched by the City of Chicago in February 2016 and since then, released 4 new versions based on feedback we&#8217;ve received from casual users. Being an open-sourced project, the code is available to everyone, allowing this application to be made for residents and by residents.
