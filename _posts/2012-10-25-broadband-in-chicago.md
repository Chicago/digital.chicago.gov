  Visit <a title="Chicago Broadband Challenge" href="http://cityofchicago.org/broadband">http://cityofchicago.org/broadband</a> to share ideas and insight as to how the city can best make use of its existing broadband infrastructure and potential uses for a future expansion of broadband access. The conversation will inform the way the City moves forward with its broadband development. Any individual, company, student, non-profit organization or community group is welcome to respond to the Broadband challenge, either informally through the website, or as part of the formal responses the city is soliciting through a request for information.
