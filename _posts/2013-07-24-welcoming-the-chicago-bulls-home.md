  The Chicago Bulls are building new training facility next to the United Center, which will spur economic opportunity, job creation and job growth for the entire West Side of the city of Chicago. &#8220;The Bulls have always been at the heart of the city of Chicago and the city of Chicago has always been behind the Chicago Bulls, and now, you are finally, after 20+ years, finally home in Chicago.&#8221; &#8211; Mayor Rahm Emanuel
